## Problem Statement

Smoking remains a significant contributor to various health complications and is responsible for preventable illnesses and millions of deaths globally, with projections indicating a surge to 10 million smoking-related deaths by 2030. Despite concerted efforts, the complexity of factors influencing smoking cessation has hindered high success rates in quitting.

To address this challenge, the problem at hand is to utilize machine learning to predict an individual's smoking status using bio-signals. The objective is to create a predictive model that considers multiple factors such as nicotine dependency, carbon monoxide levels, daily cigarette consumption, age of smoking initiation, previous quit attempts, emotional well-being, personality traits, and motivation to quit. This model aims to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in assessing the likelihood of successfully quitting smoking, thereby improving smoking cessation outcomes.

## Assignment Details

1. **Data Analysis:**
   - **Univariate Analysis:**
     - Understanding the distribution and characteristics of individual features provides crucial insights into their relevance and potential impact on model performance.
   - **Bivariate Analysis:**
     - Examining relationships between pairs of features helps identify dependencies or correlations. These identified patterns guide the selection of feature combinations that might contribute significantly to model performance during Feature Engineering.
   - **Multivariate Analysis:**
     - Assessing complex interactions among multiple features offers a deeper understanding of their combined effects. This analysis assists in feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques employed in Feature Engineering.

2. **Feature Engineering and Preprocessing:**
   - **Techniques for Feature Engineering:**
     - Leveraging insights from Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analyses, techniques for extracting, creating, and selecting features are employed. This step involves transforming raw data into meaningful representations that positively impact model accuracy and performance.
   - **Exploration of Feature Impacts:**
     - Hands-on exercises involving the manipulation of features based on data analysis findings provide a practical understanding of how feature modifications directly influence model outcomes.

3. **Ensemble Methods:**
   - You are required to implement the following ensemble methods:
     - **Bagging:**
       - Utilizes bootstrapping to train multiple models independently and combines their predictions through averaging or voting.
     - **Boosting:**
       - Builds a sequence of models, each correcting errors made by the previous ones by assigning different weights to data instances.
     - **Random Forests:**
       - Implement a Random Forest class or functions to combine multiple Decision trees using the DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn.
   - These ensemble techniques leverage the enhanced features and models created through Feature Engineering. The refined features and diverse models contribute to improved predictive accuracy and robustness when combined using these ensemble methods.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - **Grid Search:**
     - Exhaustively searches through a specified parameter grid to identify the best combination of hyperparameters.
   - **Randomized Search:**
     - Randomly samples hyperparameters from specified distributions to efficiently find optimal settings.

5. **Final System:**
   - After finishing all of your analysis, trying different ensemble methods, and fine-tuning them, you will end up with a final Machine learning system with the best performance.
